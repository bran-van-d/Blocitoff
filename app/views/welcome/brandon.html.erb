			<p>
        I began my journey into programming as a vital creative endeavor,
        a way to work and create simultaneously.
			</p>

      <p>
        I come from a teaching background. My traditional degree is in English and Education and for the past four years I have been a middle school teacher, teaching 7-8th grade English and History.
        I have always had a drive to help people and to lead them to better and stronger senses of self. In code I seek to do the same.
      </p>

       <p>
          I was drawn to web development because I realized the power the breadth that the web had to offer. The growth of the web and the increased access to it appeal to my sense of broad outreach.
          I hope to be able to use the web to reach people in meaningful and compelling ways.
       </p>
